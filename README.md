# 🪓 Hangman Game (Python)

## 🧠 Overview
A **text-based Hangman game** developed in Python as part of my internship programming task.  
This project demonstrates the use of **loops**, **conditionals**, **lists**, **strings**, and the **random module** to create a simple and fun console game.

---

## 🎯 Features
- Three difficulty levels: **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard**  
- Random word selection each time you play  
- Limit of 6 incorrect guesses  
- Displays correct and incorrect letters dynamically  
- User-friendly console interface  

---

## 🧩 Key Concepts Used
- `random` → to select random words  
- `while` loop → to control game flow  
- `if-else` → for decision making  
- `lists` and `strings` → to track letters and display progress
